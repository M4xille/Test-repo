## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
library(igraph)
library(threejs)

```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
ame <- as.matrix(read.csv2("AnNA elongatus.csv", header = T, row.names = 1))
game <- graph_from_adjacency_matrix(ame)
  net.js <- game
graph_attr(net.js, "layout") <- NULL
set.seed(70)
graphjs(net.js, main="Network! IN! 3D!", bg="gray10", vertex.size = 0.5, showLabels=T, vertex.labels = T, stroke=F, 
               curvature=0.1, attraction=0.1, repulsion=1, opacity=0.9)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
